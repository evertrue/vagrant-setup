## Vagrant Setup

This is a repository for storing common Vagrant config files.

## Usage

The suggested method of using this is to copy `vagrant-settings.rb-sample` to the root of your cookbook (renaming it to `vagrant-settings.rb`) and then to symlink `cookbook_dir/Vagrantfile` to the Vagrantfile in this directory.
